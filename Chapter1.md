# 1. Introduction #
Before I even write a word about what is PowerShell and why you need to learn it, I will give a brief overview of how I got started with automation in general, how it led me into discovering PowerShell, and how I fell in love with that! I won't bore you with a full chapter containing just my history. I will make it really quick.

I started in the IT industry back in 2001. My first job was in customer support and my role was to sit at a customer location and resolve their desktop and server issues. It was fun. I was a part of the outsourced team and therefore there was not much of scope for being creative. I just had to do what I was asked to do. Towards the end of that year, we lost the contract and I was placed at another client where, fortunately, I was the only administrator. And, that too, desktop, server, and network administrator. I know that it sounds a bit complicated but it was a blessing in disguise. For the first few days, I just went around the place and gathered as much as information I could around the state of their current IT systems and of course made a lot of new friends. One thing that stood out in my survey was the amount of manual work involved in completing daily help desk tasks. This included daily backups, daily disk space and health reporting, and so on. It felt trivial that there was no existing automation for any of these tasks and it was a low hanging fruit. I knew a bit of VB Scripting and combined that with a bit of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to automate most of the daily tasks. It was an instant success with the customer and of course let me focus on other important things.
